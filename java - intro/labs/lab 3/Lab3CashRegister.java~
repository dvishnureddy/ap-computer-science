            * Below you need to add 3 things:
            * 
            *     1. Code to allow the user to enter an int for each of the
            *        coins listed above (store these values in dollarPay,
            *        quarterPay, dimePay, etc.
            *     2. Calculate the cash amount by totaling up the number of
            *        each dollar or coin times the coin's amount.
            *     3. Calculate the change about by subtracting the cashAmount
            *        minus the purchase amount.

            * EXTRA CREDIT (If you don't do the extra credit, delete all this)
            * You will need to do three things:
            *     1. Declare 5 int variables to store the number of dollars,
            *        quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies to give as change.
            *        (call them dollarChange, quarterChange, dimeChange, etc.)
            * 
            *     2. GOING IN THIS ORDER, dollar, quarter, dime, nickel, and
            *        penny, calculate the exact number of each that you will
            *        get from the changeAmount calculated above.
            *        For example:
            *        If the changeAmount = $5.27,
            *          then dollarChange = 5
            *               quarterChange = 1
            *               dimeChange = 0
            *               nickelChange = 0
            *            &  pennyChange = 2
            * 
            *     3. Print out all your results.
            * 
            *     4. Make sure all double values that are money values round
            *        to the nearest hundredth.
